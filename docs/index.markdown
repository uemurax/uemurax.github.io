I am a postdoc at the
[Department of Mathematics](https://www.su.se/matematiska-institutionen/)
at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/).
My main research interests are in
[Homotopy Type Theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/),
in particular its semantics using (higher) category theory.
I am also interested in type theory in general and pure category theory.
